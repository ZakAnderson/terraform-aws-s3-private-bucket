## Developer Setup

Install dependencies (macOS)

```shell
brew install pre-commit go terraform terraform-docs
```

### Testing

[Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) is being used for
automated testing with this module. Tests in the `test` folder can be run
locally by running the following command:

```shell
make test
```

Or with aws-vault:

```shell
AWS_VAULT_KEYCHAIN_NAME=<NAME> aws-vault exec <PROFILE> -- make test
```

## CHANGELOG

This terraform module is undergoing an experiment where we keep a CHANGELOG for it. We're still trying to figure out how to automate this process and, for now, are manually running the command.

The changelog should be updated every time a new GitHub release is cut.

To do so, you should have a Github token with "repo" scope that can be loaded in as an environment variable. You can find more info [here](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator#github-token).

```sh
export CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN="«your-40-digit-github-token»"
```

The command to run on your terminal:

```sh
docker run --env CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN="$CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN" --rm -v "$(pwd)":/usr/local/src/your-app ferrarimarco/github-changelog-generator -u trussworks -p terraform-aws-s3-private-bucket
```
